Note that the data on this page summarizes findings from the OWL files available on obofoundry.org, most of which represent a complete ontology, however some represent smaller projects or add-ons for a given ontology. If the smaller OWL files are part of a foundry ontology record they are categorized as 'foundry' here. This is the reason why there are 13 'foundry' OBOs noted here, while there are only 10 'foundry' ontologies listed on obofoundry.org."/></sup></h4>

'timeout' indicates that the cycle detection did not complete within 1 hour. 'failure' indicates that cycle detection failed for an unspecified reason (see the logs for details). In most cases the reason for failure seems to be an out-of-memory error (10GB was allocated for each cycle detection process). 'n/a' indicates an OWL file that was excluded because it is unavailable for download or its imports are not resolvable."/></sup></h4>
