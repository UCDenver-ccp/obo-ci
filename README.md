See the `scripts/` directory for project requirements as well as the scripts to launch the analyses. This project is under active development (Dec 2017). More comprehensive usage instructions will be added shortly. 



A more permanent location for displaying results will be coming soon as well, however the following link provides a snapshot of OBO analysis results:
