This project contains code to run various analyses focused on evaluating the interoperability of the [Open Biomedical Ontologies](http://obofoundry.org) (OBOs). Classification of all OBOs is attempted using OWL Reasoners on both an individual basis to gauge individual ontology consistency as well as on a pairwise basis as a first step towards evaluating the global interoperability of the OBOs. This project has been under active development since December of 2017.
